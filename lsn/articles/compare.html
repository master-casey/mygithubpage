            <h1>Congratulations, Class of 2007</h1>

        Middle school, the most trying time of your life. Or maybe just that part of your life you're too embarrassed to remember. If you disagree with this latter sentiment, I challenge you to pull out your 7th grade Notebook o' Poetry or your 8th grade Notebook o' Fanfiction, take a whiff, and just <i>try</i> not to impale your eyeballs with a spatula. You'll lose, probably. And if you don't - well, then I guess that means that you haven't grown since you were in middle school, which means you <i>really</i> lose. (Hey - you were inducted into the Loser Squad for a reason.)<p>

        Even if you still think that those really deep song lyrics you wrote in sixth grade still moves mountains, a lot has changed in the past eight years - and a lot hasn't, for those of you who have burned all evidence of ever having a creative muse in middle school. For example, think about where you were in middle school with all your goals and ambitions. Then think of all the things you <i>didn't</i> know in middle school, like how to pay a credit card bill, or that the BS on a resume stood for Bachelor's of Science and not bullshit. Now think of everything you know now. It's a lot more, isn't it? Granted, there's still a few things that you're not entirely sure about - maybe, like how to pay a credit card bill - but these eight years have matured and wisened you.<p>
